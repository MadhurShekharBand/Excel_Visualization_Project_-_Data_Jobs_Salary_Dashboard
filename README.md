# Introduction:
The Salary Dashboard was created to help job seekers explore salary data across different job titles and regions. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide valuable insights for individuals looking to assess their compensation relative to industry standards and determine if they are being adequately compensated for their work. By using real-world data from 2023, this dashboard allows users to dive into the details of job titles, salaries, locations, and the essential skills required for various roles.

# Background:

### The questions I wanted to answer through this project were:

- **How do salaries vary by job title?** <br>
By examining how salaries differ across various job titles, the goal is to understand which roles in the data science field offer higher compensation. This can help job seekers make more informed decisions when choosing a career path and negotiate better salaries based on the role they are pursuing.

- **How does geography influence salary?** <br>
This question aims to explore how location impacts salary levels for data-related jobs. By understanding the geographic factors at play, individuals can determine if relocating to a different country or region may result in higher earnings.

- **What impact does job schedule (full-time, part-time, etc.) have on salary?** <br>
This question seeks to understand how different work arrangements—such as full-time, part-time, and contract roles—affect overall salary. The answer to this can help professionals evaluate whether a full-time position offers significantly better compensation compared to part-time or freelance work.

- **What skills correlate with higher salaries?** <br>
By investigating the relationship between job-specific skills and salary, we aim to identify which technical skills are most likely to increase earning potential in the data science field. This insight will inform job seekers about which skills they should focus on to enhance their value in the job market and maximize their salary prospects.

### About the Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes real-world job data sourced from the field of data science, specifically focusing on salaries across various job titles, countries, and types of work. It includes key variables such as job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills, all of which are crucial for understanding salary trends and making informed career decisions. The dataset reflects salaries in different countries and regions, with a focus on providing median salary values, which offer a more stable and representative measure of typical earnings within each job category.

### Excel Skills Used:
The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:
- Charts
- Formulas and Functions
- Data Validation

# Insights:
- Senior roles like Data Scientists and Data Engineers have significantly higher salaries than entry-level roles such as Analysts. Job seekers pursuing a career in data science should consider aiming for senior roles to maximize their earning potential. Also, as expected, experienced professionals can command higher salaries compared to those in entry-level positions.
- Countries like the United States, Switzerland, and Australia offer notably higher median salaries compared to other regions. Professionals in the data science field may benefit from relocating to countries with higher salary prospects, particularly if they are seeking greater financial rewards and opportunities for growth.
- Job seekers should consider full-time roles as a more financially stable and rewarding option, with senior full-time positions offering substantial salary benefits compared to part-time or freelance alternatives.
- Skills in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Engineering are closely tied to higher salaries. Acquiring specialized technical skills in high-demand areas like machine learning or cloud computing can significantly increase salary potential, making these skills a key focus for professionals looking to boost their earning power.

# Conclusion:

### What I Learned:
Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how Excel's powerful data analysis tools can be used to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Additionally, I learned how to create compelling visualizations using charts like bar and map charts to effectively communicate findings. This project reinforced the importance of not only analyzing data but also presenting it in a way that is easily digestible for users, ensuring they can make informed decisions. It also highlighted how geographic and job-specific factors shape salary trends, providing a broader perspective on global job markets.

### Closing Thoughts:
In conclusion, this Salary Dashboard project has been an insightful and educational experience. By leveraging Excel’s features, I was able to uncover meaningful salary trends. Building this dashboard helped me to understand how salaries are influenced by job titles, locations, and skills. It also highlighted the powerful capabilities of Excel in the realm of data analysis.
